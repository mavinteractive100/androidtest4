# Project Requirements:
- Fetch all films from the Studio Ghibli API (https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films) and display them in a user-friendly UI.
- User must be able to refresh the films page.
- User must be able to click a film and display more details.
- Features that improve usability should also be considered (e.g searching, pagination, filters).
- If using other libraries, please use Gradle as a dependency manager

Recommendations:
- Retrofit is recommended to consume the HTTP API.
- You can read up on other endpoints available at https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/
- Making use of other endpoints/APIs/libraries is 100% allowed and encouraged.
- Don't just consider best case scenarios, consider worst case scenarios too! (i.e no internet, backend is down, timeouts, etc)
- Consider including automated unit/UI testing if possible.
- Do consider other improvements that would make the app more fun!

All code must be pushed to a Github project, and the url is to be shared with us. You have until Monday end-of-day to complete this assignment.
